		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>
		  <b>
		    Give a high-level overview of what you implemented in this homework. Think about what you've built as a whole. Share your thoughts on what interesting things you've learned from completing the homework.
		  </b>
		</p>

		<h2>Part 1: Ray Generation and Scene Intersection</h2>

		<p>
		  <b>
		    Walk through the ray generation and primitive intersection parts of the rendering pipeline.
		  </b>
		</p>

		<p>
		  We implemented raytracing with a for loop that iterates over the number of random samples (ns_aa) of some pixel (x, y) in the image.
		  After we normalize the x and y values over the image's dimensions, we compute the radiance of each sampled ray. We then get the sum of radiances
		  and divide it by the number of samples to get the average estimated radiance, which is then written to the sample buffer after updating the pixel
		  with the average radiance color.
		</p>

		<p>
		  <b>
		    Explain the triangle intersection algorithm you implemented in your own words.
		  </b>
		</p>

		<p>
		  The triangle intersection algorithm was pretty much based off the Möller-Trumbore Algorithm as described in Lecture 9-10, slide 21.
		  If the ray's direction is parallel to the triangle, there is no intersection (S1 * E1 == 0).
		  We calculate Barycentric coordinates as shown in the diagram from lecture, and use those along with r.min_t and r.max_t to test for intersection.
		</p>

		<h2>Part 2: Bounding Volume Hierarchy</h2>
			
		<p>
		  <b>
		    Walk through your BVH construction algorithm. Explain the heuristic you chose for picking the splitting point.
		  </b>
		</p>

		<p>
		  <b>
		    Show images with normal shading for a few large .dae files that you can only render with BVH acceleration.
		  </b>
		</p>

		<p>
		  <b>
		    Compare rendering times on a few scenes with moderately complex geometries with and without BVH acceleration. Present your results in a one-paragraph analysis.
		  </b>

		<h2>Additional Notes (please remove)</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>You can also add code if you'd like as so: <code>code code code</code></li>
			<li>If you'd like to add math equations, 
				<ul>
					<li>You can write inline equations like so: \( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \)</li>
