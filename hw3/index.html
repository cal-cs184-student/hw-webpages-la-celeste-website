		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>
		  <b>
		    Give a high-level overview of what you implemented in this homework. Think about what you've built as a whole. Share your thoughts on what interesting things you've learned from completing the homework.
		  </b>
		</p>

		<p>
		  Sample with a purpose!
		</p>
		
		<p>
		  When you're trying to obtain knowledge from a data source, such as finding light sources, you can't
		  rely on luck to get accurate estimations. We see that uniform hemisphere sampling is essentially throwing darts while blindfolded.
		  It will eventually converge to the correct light sources, but we'll hit several non-light objects in the process. This gives
		  us noisy renderings of scenes. On the other hand, importance sampling specifically samples directions towards light sources.
		  Each sample will most likely contribute to the final rendering. The resulting scene will be much smoother, and we can finally
		  render scenes with point lights.

		<h2>Part 1: Ray Generation and Scene Intersection</h2>

		<p>
		  <b>
		    Walk through the ray generation and primitive intersection parts of the rendering pipeline.
		  </b>
		</p>

		<p>
		  We implemented raytracing with a for loop that iterates over the number of random samples (ns_aa) of some pixel (x, y) in the image.
		  After we normalize the x and y values over the image's dimensions, we compute the radiance of each sampled ray. We then get the sum of radiances
		  and divide it by the number of samples to get the average estimated radiance, which is then written to the sample buffer after updating the pixel
		  with the average radiance color.
		</p>

		<p>
		  <b>
		    Explain the triangle intersection algorithm you implemented in your own words.
		  </b>
		</p>

		<p>
		  The triangle intersection algorithm was pretty much based off the Möller-Trumbore Algorithm as described in Lecture 9-10, slide 21.
		  If the ray's direction is parallel to the triangle, there is no intersection (S1 * E1 == 0).
		  We calculate Barycentric coordinates as shown in the diagram from lecture, and use those along with r.min_t and r.max_t to test for intersection.

		<h2>Part 2: Bounding Volume Hierarchy</h2>
			
		<p>
		  <b>
		    Walk through your BVH construction algorithm. Explain the heuristic you chose for picking the splitting point.
		  </b>
		</p>

		<p>
		  Our BVH construction algorithm constructs a binary tree where each node has a bounding box, which we expanded as necessary.
		  If the current node has less than <code>max_leaf_size</code> primitives, then it's a leaf node. We give it iterators to the start and end of its primitives, and return.
		  Afterwards, we handle the internal node case. We select the splitting axis in a way that creates a balanced tree.
		  Our splitting heuristic is a median split. First, we determine which axis has the largest range in the bounding box.
		  Then, we sort the primitives based on their bounding box's centroid along the chosen axis.
		  We split the primitives in the middle, and finally recursively call construct_bvh() on both sides of this half.
		  This reduces the expected runtime from O(n) to O(log(n)), significantly speeding up the rendering process.
		</p>

		<p>
		  As you can see in the images below, implementing BVH substantially sped up the rendering runtime. It appears that the BVH implementation spends SLIGHTLY more time
		  on collecting primitives and building the BVH (since this isn't relevant to the non-BVH implementation). The BVH implementation took roughly 1/100th of the time
		  to render, its average speed was roughly 100 times faster, and it averaged roughly 100 times less intersection tests per ray.

		<h2>Part 3: Direct Illumination</h2>

		<p>
		  <b>
		    Walk through both implementations of the direct lighting function.
		  </b>
		</p>

		<p>
		  For hemisphere sampling, we iterate through each sample in num_samples. For each sample, we randomly grab a direction uniformly
		  across the hemisphere (w_in) with <code>hemisphereSampler->get_sample()</code>. We create a new ray from hit_point (+ EPS_D to avoid
		  self-intersection) in w_in's direction converted to world space, and see if it intersects an object in the scene. If the intersected
		  object in question is a light source, we accumulate the contribution according to the BSDF formula described in lecture, where the
		  PDF is <code>1 / (2 * PI)</code>. Finally, we normalize L_out by the number of samples, which gives us the Monte Carlo estimate.
		</p>

		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
		  <table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">

	                <img src="images/uniform_BSDF.png" width="400px"/>
		    </tr>
		  </table>
		</div>

		<p>
		  For importance sampling, we iterate through each light in the scene. First, we define num_samples as 1 if it's a delta light,
		  and ns_area_light for area lights. For each sample, we obtain w_in_world as the incoming direction with sample_L. We also
		  get the distance to the light, and the light's PDF. We calculate the cosine between the surface normal and the light's direction.
		  We use that to cast a shadow ray from hit_point to the light source. We add the light's contribution to total_light if it is
		  in front of the surface (cosine test) and if there's nothing blocking hit_point and the light source. We then accumulate L_out
		  based on the BSDF as described in lecture. Finally, we average all the samples for each light, and take this sum as the
		  total direct lighting.

		  <b>
		    Compare the results between uniform hemisphere sampling and lighting sampling in a one-paragraph analysis.
		  </b>
		</p>

		<p>
		  The hemisphere sampling image looks noticeably grainier than the importance sampling when running the same specs.
		  Particularly on the walls and floor, there is a lot more noise in the hemisphere rendering. Importance sampling gives us better
		  results because it prioritizes rays that will contribute to the illumination, rather than randomly picking directions.
		</p>

		<h2>Part 4: Global Illumination</h2>
		
		<p>
		  <b>
		    Walk through your implementation of the indirect lighting function.
		  </b>
		</p>

		<p>
		  For the indirect lighting function, we first check if the ray has exceeded its maximum depth. If so, we only return the one bounce radiance.
		  If it hasn't exceeded the max depth, we use importance sampling with <code>isect.bdsf->sample_f()</code> to sample the incoming direction
		  (w_in). This also lets us get the PDF. Then, we defined a variable called termination_prob for Russian roulette that's set to 0.3. While
		  Russian roulette isn't stopping our path, we convert the sampled direction to world space. We create a new ray with an increased depth,
		  and check for intersections. If there is an intersection, we recursively call at_least_one_bounce_radiance() and weigh the contribution
		  by the BSDF value, cosine term, and PDF. Finally, after we trace every path and accumulate their contributions, we return the summed L_out.

		  the light wouldn't have the chance to bounce back to the ceiling (since it's coming from the ceiling).
		  The bunny and its shadow are also visible.
		</p>

		<p>
		  Starting at Depth 2, we're at the stage where the light can bounce onto any part of the room. This
		  makes the shading more realistic, but it has diminishing returns as the depth level increases.
		  This is because light loses energy as it bounces off a surface. As such, it makes sense that
		  Depth 3 essentially looks like a darker version of Depth 2. This pattern continues through
		  later depths, where Depth 5 already looks nearly pitch-black.

		</p>

		<p>
		  Starting at Depth 2, the shading looks more realistic and it is now accumulated with previous depths.
		  We still see diminishing returns, but in a different way than in the unaccumulated case. As we increase

		  When we render this scene with 1 sample per pixel, it generates the room, spheres, and shading accurately.
		  However, it is extremely grainy in quality. It looks slightly less grainy in 2 samples per pixel, but it's
		  still pretty bad. As we keep increasing the number of samples per pixel, the graininess eventually goes away.
		  By the time we reach 1,024 samples per pixel, the resulting scene looks incredibly smooth.

		<h2>Part 5: Adaptive Sampling</h2>

		<p>
		  <b>
		    Explain adaptive sampling. Walk through your implementation of the adaptive sampling.
		  </b>
		</p>

		<p>
		  Adaptive sampling is essentially a sampling technique where you adjust the number of samples based on
		  how complex a pixel's lighting is (i.e. high variance). We implemented this with s1 (illuminance sum),
		  s2 (squared illuminance sum), and n (number of samples) as described in the writeup. We have a for loop
		  that iterates over samples until we reach the max amount of samples, or we reach the convergence condition.
		  We calculate x_k with <code>radiance.illum()</code> and use it to update the values for s1 and s2.
		  Then, as suggested in the writeup, we check convergence every <code>samplesPerBatch=32</code> pixels.
		  We calculate μ and σ² properly, then use them to see if I is less than maxTolerance * μ. If so, the sample has converged,
		  and we can break out of the for loop. We then divide the radiance sum by n to obtain the average radiance,
		  update the sample buffer, and update the sample count buffer accordingly.
		</p>

		<p>
		  <b>
		    Pick two scenes and render them with at least 2048 samples per pixel. Show a good sampling rate image with clearly visible differences in sampling rate over various regions and pixels. Include both your sample rate image, which shows your how your adaptive sampling changes depending on which part of the image you are rendering, and your noise-free rendered result. Use 1 sample per light and at least 5 for max ray depth.

		  For both images, the termination probability is 0.30.
