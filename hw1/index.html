		<h2>Overview</h2>
		Give a high-level overview of what you implemented in this homework. Think about what you've built as a whole. Share your thoughts on what interesting things you've learned from completing the homework.
		<p>It was really satisfying to learn different techniques to improve the quality of different images. Supersampling is my favorite algorithm that I learned, because of how intuitive it is. Before it was mentioned in lecture, I thought “why can’t we just assign a percentage to how much a point is inside the triangle, so we can shade that pixel accordingly?” The GUI tools also helped a lot for my understanding. I especially liked using Z to open the the pixel inspector, as this let me see the blurry vs blocky differences with bilinear and nearest sampling.</p>


		<h2>Task 1: Drawing Single-Color Triangles</h2>
		<b>Walk through how you rasterize triangles in your own words.</b>
		<p>I was very much inspired by the pseudocode and approaches described in lecture. First, I had to find the bounds for xmax and ymax. I simply did this by taking max(x1, x2, x3) and max(y1, y2, y3) since these three points are already provided to us. I then calculated three edges: 01 (from vertex 0 to vertex 1), 12, and 20. We’re about to see why this is useful.</p>
		<p>I looked at the lecture notes (again) and applied the three line tests, creating 3 functions that determine if a point is inside these lines.</p>
		<p>Now, we can get into the meat of the for loop.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>For each point, sample at the pixel center (x + 0.5, y + 0.5)
			<li>Run the three line tests
			<li>Fill the pixel with the triangle’s color ONLY IF all tests are ≥ 0, meaning that the point is inside the triangle.
		</ul>
		<p>I was getting frustrated by Basic Test 6 because the counter-clockwise hexagons weren’t getting filled in.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>I resolved this issue by calculating the area as (x1 - x0) * (y2 - y0) - (x2 - x0) * (y1 - y0), setting the orientation to 1 if the area is positive, and -1 if it’s negative.
			<li>I then updated the line tests to multiply the final result by the orientation. This allowed my code to work for clockwise and counterclockwise cases.
		</ul>
		<p><b>Explain how your algorithm is no worse than one that checks each sample within the bounding box of the triangle. The bounding box of the triangle is defined as the smallest rectangle that can be drawn whilst ensuring that the entire triangle is within it.</b>
		<p>Well…my algorithm is no worse than checking every sample within the bounding box of the triangle, because that’s what I just did.
		<p>Calculating the max/min values of x and y and iterating over every (x,y) point in between creates the smallest possible rectangle that surrounds the provided points.
		



		<p>Here is an example 2x2 gridlike structure using an HTML table. Each <b>tr</b> is a row and each <b>td</b> is a column in that row. You might find this useful for framing and showing your result images in an organized fashion.</p>
		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
			  <tr>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="lion.jpg" width="400px"/>
				  <figcaption>Caption goes here.</figcaption>

		<h2>Task 2: Antialiasing by Supersampling</h2>
		<p><b>Walk through your supersampling algorithm and data structures. Why is supersampling useful? What modifications did you make to the rasterization pipeline in the process? Explain how you used supersampling to antialias your triangles.</b>
		<p>I made use of the built-in sample buffer. It’s a 1D vector that contains all samples.
		<ul>
			<li>Its size is width * height * sample_rate, which is the number of subsamples per pixel.
		</ul>
		<p>I also used the built-in RGB framebuffer, which stores the final image that will be displayed.
		<ul>
			<li>Its size is 3 * width * height because there are three channels (Red/Green/Blue).
		</ul>
		<p>I updated the set_sample_rate() and set_framebuffer_target() functions to accommodate for the sample rate that we’re now using.
		<p>fill_pixel() was also updated, now it has a for loop that writes to all subsamples of a pixel.
		<p>I updated the algorithm by modifying rasterize_triangle() to implement supersampling.
		<ul>
			<li>In Task 1, it was a double for loop that selected every sample within the bounding box.
			<li>Now, for each pixel, there are additional nested for loops “i” and “j” that iterate over the (square root of the) sample rate.
			<li>We write to the sample buffer for every subsample that passes all three line tests.
			<li>Now, as we write the result to the framebuffer, we take the average of every pixel’s subsample. This gives us a more nuanced color shade than the binary “triangle” or “not triangle”.
		</ul>
		<p>Now, as we write the result to the framebuffer, we take the average of every pixel’s subsample. This gives us a more nuanced color shade than the binary “triangle” or “not triangle”.
		<p><b>Show png screenshots of basic/test4.svg with the default viewing parameters and sample rates 1, 4, and 16 to compare them side-by-side. Position the pixel inspector over an area that showcases the effect dramatically; for example, a very skinny triangle corner. Explain why these results are observed.</b>
		<p>Pictured: Sample rates 1, 4, 16 respectively.
		<p>When the sample rate is 1, we can see particularly horrid jaggies in regions like the red triangle’s edges. Some parts of the triangle seem completely disjointed.
		<p>However, the sample rates of 4 and 16 give us smoother triangles because they average the colors around the triangles’ edges.

		<h2>Task 3: Transforms</h2>
		<p><b>Create an updated version of svg/transforms/robot.svg with cubeman doing something more interesting, like waving or running. Feel free to change his colors or proportions to suit your creativity. Save your svg file as my_robot.svg in your docs/ directory and show a png screenshot of your rendered drawing in your write-up. Explain what you were trying to do with cubeman in words.</b></p>
		<p>I created a diva robot with hands on its hips. I was inspired by Stefon Diggs’ iconic, dramatic photo after his team lost to the Chiefs in the playoffs.</p>
